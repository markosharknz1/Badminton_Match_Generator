# Game Scheduler — Progress / Handoff Doc

Read this first if you're picking up this project in a new conversation.

## What this is

A locally-installed app for running **adult badminton club sessions**: check
players in, track who's waiting, build or auto-generate court games with
skill/gender balancing, and track payment per player per session. Separate
codebase/database from an existing **junior training-session app** that also
lives on this machine at `C:\Claude\badminton_club` (Python/Flask) — that one
is untouched and out of scope; don't read or modify it.

## Stack & non-negotiables (from the original spec)

- Node.js + Express + **sql.js** (pure-JS SQLite — avoids native build tools
  that broke `better-sqlite3` on Windows previously)
- Fully local, no cloud dependency, transportable via file copy (OneDrive
  sync between machines — not git, though a GitHub repo now also exists,
  see below)
- Single project folder, own `package.json`, own `.db` file
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0` (not just localhost) so a TV on the club wifi can
  reach the `/display.html` kiosk screen

## How to run it

**Double-click `GameScheduler.exe`** — that's the only file end users ever
need to touch, first run or the hundredth. It's a real compiled Windows
executable (built from `launcher.py` via PyInstaller - Python/pywebview/
pythonnet are all bundled inside it, nothing to install for the launcher
itself), not a batch file. It opens the app in a real native window via
pywebview (Windows' built-in WebView2, not a browser tab), and closing that
window stops everything cleanly (server included) — no console window, no
leftover background process.

The *first* time it's run on a machine (or if Node.js is missing - the one
remaining external dependency, since it's what actually runs server.js),
`GameScheduler.exe` shows a message box, installs Node.js via `winget`, then
applies the DB schema (idempotent, safe to re-run, never touches real data)
and opens the app. Every run after that is instant and silent - no dialog,
no console, ever (there never was a console - pythonw/PyInstaller's
`--noconsole` build has none).

To rebuild the exe after changing `launcher.py`: double-click
`build_exe.bat` (dev-only tool, not something end users ever run) - it
reinvokes PyInstaller and copies the result over the committed
`GameScheduler.exe` at the project root.

Manual equivalent (what the scripts wrap), useful when debugging:
```
cd C:\Claude\Game_Scheduler
node server.js
```
Open **http://localhost:4000** (port changed from the original 3000 — user
asked for a non-3000 port; override anytime with `set PORT=xxxx`).

Leave that window open — closing it stops the server, which freezes session
timers mid-session (by design, per spec).

To reseed fresh demo data at any time (wipes and rebuilds all tables):
```
node db/seed.js
```
Seeds 24 fake players, 7 courts, 6 payment categories, 4 session templates
(Monday evening/manual, Thursday morning/auto, Thursday evening/manual,
**Friday social**), one open "Monday evening" session with 16 players
checked in and one completed round.

Test suites (all pure, isolated, no shared state with the real dev db):
```
npm run csv:test       # CSV import dedup logic (19 tests)
npm run autogen:test   # auto-generate algorithm (12 tests)
npm run report:test    # Excel export / peak-concurrent metric (7 tests)
```

## Repository

Pushed to GitHub: **https://github.com/markosharknz1/Badminton_Match_Generator**
(private). `.gitignore` excludes `*.log`, `game_scheduler.db`, `exports/` —
**`node_modules/` is deliberately committed** (see design decisions below),
so this is one of the rare Node projects where you should *not* gitignore it.
Push new commits yourself, or ask Claude to.

### Working on this remotely via claude.ai (not just this local Claude Code setup)

The repo is already set up for this - connect it once via claude.ai's
GitHub connector (Settings → Connectors → GitHub, authorize, pick this
repo), then a claude.ai chat can read/edit/commit to it directly.

Two things to know before doing this:
1. **Read this whole file first** in that remote session - it's written
   for exactly this purpose (a fresh session with no memory of the build).
2. **A plain claude.ai chat almost certainly can't run/test Node code the
   way Claude Code does here** (no persistent server, no real browser to
   click through). Treat remote edits as *proposed* changes: `git pull`
   them locally afterward and actually run the app (or ask Claude Code to)
   before trusting them - this project's whole history so far has been
   "verify live before calling it done" (see the testing pattern section),
   and that discipline doesn't carry over automatically to a chat session
   that can't execute the code. Conversely, if you make local changes in
   Claude Code, `git push` before switching to a remote session, and
   `git pull` before resuming locally, so the two don't diverge.

## Build status — all done

The app was built in the 12 layers below (each built, curl/browser-tested,
and verified working before moving to the next), plus follow-on feature
requests after the initial build.

| # | Layer | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DB schema + migrations + seed + verify | ✅ |
| 2 | Core CRUD API (players, sessions, attendance, courts, club settings) | ✅ |
| 3 | CSV import + dedup logic | ✅ |
| 4 | Session templates + "same as usual"/"need to change something" start flow | ✅ |
| 5 | Check-in flow UI (two-table layout, double-click add/remove) | ✅ |
| 6 | Real-time sync (SSE) across all tabs | ✅ |
| 7 | Manual game builder (drag-and-drop, staged future rounds) | ✅ |
| 8 | Auto-generate algorithm + unattended scheduler | ✅ |
| 9 | Read-only kiosk Display screen | ✅ |
| 10 | Club management page (settings, courts, skill matrix, templates, CSV import) | ✅ |
| 11 | Session history / audit view | ✅ |
| 12 | Excel session-trend export | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: third "social" session mode** (check-in + payment only, no rounds) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: full payment-category system** (Member/Non-Member/Concession/etc., per-template pricing, "Other + note" for free entries, "first time" flag) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: payment tracking made optional**, gated by `club_settings.square_enabled` toggle | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: port changed** from 3000 default to 4000 default | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: pushed to GitHub** (private repo) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: Display screen — wall clock, 2-minute warning banner, combined "next match starts in" countdown (remaining + break), escalating break-phase urgency styling** | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: vendored `node_modules` + pinned exact dependency versions** (no cloud/npm-registry dependency at install time, ever) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: `Install.bat` / `Run.bat`** — double-click setup, and double-click launch that opens the app in its own window automatically | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: Excel (.xlsx) player import** — upload the club's membership export directly (Rego #/Full Name/Gender/Mbshp Type/Status columns); Comp A/B/C maps to skill grade, Social/Junior default to C flagged for review; reuses the existing dedup/commit pipeline | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: `db.ensureBaselineDefaults()`** — self-heals club_settings/courts/payment_categories/skill_compatibility if empty (fixes the Club page crashing when the demo-data prompt is declined at install, the correct real-club choice) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: `Install.bat` auto-installs Node.js LTS via winget** if missing, with a registry-based PATH refresh so the same window can use it immediately | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: installable PWA** — manifest.json + icons + service worker (app-shell caching, API calls always hit the network live) + a header "+ Install app" button wired to the native browser install prompt, so the app gets a real Start Menu/taskbar icon (no Electron - this is Edge's native install support) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: `launcher.py` replaces the console-window launcher** — Run.bat now opens a real native app window via pywebview (uses Windows' built-in WebView2 runtime, not a bundled Chromium like Electron); closing that window stops the server automatically, no console ever shown, no separate "save" step needed (every write already persists immediately). `Stop.bat` added as a manual fallback. `Install.bat` auto-installs Python via winget + pins `pywebview`/`pythonnet` versions, same pattern as the Node.js auto-install | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: Display link fixed to stay inside the app shell** — the Display nav link's `target="_blank"` was falling through to WebView2's default behaviour of opening a real separate Edge browser window. `launcher.py` now exposes a `js_api` (`Api.open_display()`) and `pwa.js` intercepts the click (only when `window.pywebview` exists, i.e. inside the native shell) to open a second chromeless pywebview window instead - verified via process-count check (Edge process count unchanged, pywebview window count went 1→2) | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: Display screen redesigned for at-a-glance legibility** — courts grid beside a single-column resting list (no grades anywhere - it's member-facing), 4 courts max per row, big bold court numbers/names sized to read from across a room by a 40-50 person crowd, teams shown as stacked names (no "&"/"vs") with a clear gap between partners and an even clearer gap between the two teams, long names truncate with ellipsis instead of wrapping (keeps the grid uniform - and fixed a real bug this surfaced, `min-width:0` needed on grid items or long unwrapped names blow out the grid horizontally). Verified at true 1920x1080 and against 6-10 court counts populated with real club member names | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: check-in now pops a details modal** — double-clicking an available player opens a modal (name, "Edit" toggle for the full player profile, and - when payment tracking is on - a required payment category dropdown sourced from the session's own payment rates, amount, first-time flag, note) instead of silently checking them in; check-in and payment are recorded together in one action. When payment tracking is off the modal still opens (no payment section) and check-in needs no extra input. The existing "Here today" payment-cell modal (for fixing payment after the fact) is untouched. Verified live: required-payment validation blocks check-in, edit-and-save persists to the real player record, and the full check-in-with-payment flow writes the correct attendance + payment row | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: v1.0.0 tagged + GitHub release published**, then `Install.bat` folded into `Run.bat`** — a downloaded release needed two double-clicks (Install.bat, then Run.bat) to get running; not truly one-click. `Run.bat` now branches itself: if Node/Python/pywebview are all already present it launches instantly with zero console window (the every-day path); otherwise it shows the same setup screen Install.bat used to (minus the interactive demo-data prompt, which real club use should always decline anyway) and then launches. `Install.bat` deleted - one file to double-click, first run or the hundredth. Also hardened `launcher.py`: since pythonw has no console, any startup failure (missing dependency, WebView2 issue, etc.) now shows a real Windows message box instead of the window just never appearing with no explanation | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: v1.0.1 released** - Display screen header stripped down to just the courts/countdown/resting (dropped club name and session label/date, less to read from a distance). Verified by downloading and running the actual published release zip in an isolated folder, not just the working tree | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: "first time visitor" and "new member" are two independent flags on attendance**, and neither requires payment tracking any more — both checkboxes/badges were nested inside the payment section of the check-in modal/"Here today" table, so clubs with payment tracking off had no way to flag either at all. Added `attendance.new_member` (mirrors `first_time` - a one-off per-visit flag, not a persistent player attribute) via `db/index.js`'s new `ensureColumns()` migration (additive `ALTER TABLE`, idempotent, runs on every boot alongside `ensureBaselineDefaults` - retrofits the column onto existing real databases without touching their data). Both checkboxes moved out of the payment section to always show in the check-in modal, and both badges ("1st" / "New") now render next to the player's name in "Here today" regardless of payment tracking. Verified live: migration runs cleanly against the real 141-player database, both flags record independently (one ticked without the other), and both still work correctly with payment tracking off | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: `GameScheduler.exe` replaces `Run.bat`** — a real compiled Windows executable (PyInstaller `--onefile --noconsole`), not a batch file. `launcher.py` now also absorbs the Node.js-install-via-winget logic that used to live in `Run.bat` (Python/pywebview/pythonnet are bundled inside the exe itself, so the only remaining external dependency is Node.js, installed automatically on first run if missing). `Install.bat`/`Run.bat` are both gone; `build_exe.bat` is the dev-only tool that rebuilds the committed exe after a `launcher.py` change. Verified: built and ran the actual exe (not just the script) end-to-end - real native window, correct icon, zero console anywhere, real data intact, clean shutdown with no orphaned processes | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: "Club" renamed to "Club Settings"; new "Members" page split out** — roster browse/search/inline-edit/delete (`public/members.html`/`.js`, reusing the existing player CRUD endpoints) and the CSV/Excel import section (moved off Club Settings) now live on their own page, separate from club-wide config. Also added automatic database backups: `db/index.js`'s `backupToDocuments()` copies `game_scheduler.db` to `Documents\GameScheduler\backups` once per server boot (timestamped, prunes down to the newest 30, never throws - a failed backup can't block the app from starting), plus a `routes/backup.js` with manual "back up now" and "download a copy" actions surfaced on the Members page. Verified live: automatic backup file appears in the real Documents folder on boot, inline edit persists to the real DB, add/delete both work, manual backup-now creates a second real file, and the download endpoint streams a valid copy | ✅ |
| — | **Bug fix: `sw.js` was cache-first, so an updated release could still show old cached pages** — every version of the app serves from the same `http://localhost:4000` origin, so WebView2's cache/service-worker persists across app updates (a real user hit this: installed v1.0.4, still saw pre-Members-page content). `GameScheduler.exe` already waits for the server to be ready before opening the window (`launcher.py`'s `start_server()`), so the cache-first "still opens if the server is slow" justification never actually applied to the exe launch path. Switched to network-first (cache only as a last-resort fallback if the network genuinely fails) and bumped the cache name to force one clean transition. Verified by reproducing the exact bug - modified a live file's content, reloaded a tab with an already-registered old-style service worker and populated cache with no manual cache-clearing, confirmed the new content appeared immediately | ✅ |
| — | **Follow-on: nav reordered, Settings restructured into a dropdown, Player Database, live mode switcher, grade promoted at check-in** — several changes landed together: (1) nav order is now Check-in/Rounds/Display/Player Database/History/Settings, with "Settings" always last; (2) the old "Club Settings" page is now driven by a `<select>` (`data-section` show/hide, `club.js`'s `showSettingsSection()`) with six options - Club Details (club name + payment categories, merged), Courts, Skill Compatibility, Session Templates, Email, Payments; (3) new Email (SMTP2Go) and Payments (Square) sections save credentials to five new `club_settings` columns via the existing `ensureColumns()` migration pattern - settings/storage only, nothing sends email or processes a real payment yet (confirmed with the user before building - the Junior Club Training app doesn't have these built either, so there was no existing pattern to copy); (4) Members renamed to "Player Database" and redesigned from always-editable rows to a read-only list with a per-row Edit/Save/Cancel toggle (`editingMemberId` in `members.js`); (5) session mode (manual/auto/social) can now be changed live from a dropdown in the header on Check-in and Rounds - `PUT /api/sessions/:id` already supported this, it just had no UI - verified switching modes actually flips the Rounds page's manage/social panels live; (6) the check-in popup's Grade field moved out from behind "Edit" to sit directly next to the player's name, saving immediately on change (most commonly changed field, shouldn't need an extra click) - still the same player record, "sticks with the player" same as before. Verified live end-to-end: DB migration ran clean against the real database, Club Details shows both merged panels, Courts/Skill/Templates each render correctly when selected, Email/Payments credentials round-tripped through a save+reload, Player Database's read-only-then-edit toggle confirmed both ways, mode switch confirmed via the real DB value and the Rounds page's panel actually flipping, and Grade-at-check-in confirmed persisting to the player record without needing "Edit" | ✅ |

| — | **Follow-on: manual mode - drag players back out of a court, not just in** — filled slots (when a court is editable - a fresh draft or a staged court with "Edit" clicked) are now `draggable`, and dropping one on the player-pool sidebar unassigns them; dropping one on another court's side slot moves them there directly, without a trip through the pool. Testing this surfaced a real bug and fixed it before shipping: `dropPlayer()` used to remove the player from their source slot unconditionally, then reject the drop if the target was full - silently losing them from the draft entirely. Rewrote it to check target capacity (correctly excluding the player's own current slot, so a same-court side swap isn't miscounted as "occupied by self") *before* touching the source, so a rejected drop leaves the player exactly where they started. Verified live with real staged round data: drag-to-pool, drag-to-full-slot (confirmed rejected with zero data loss, confirmed via the real staged game afterward), and a genuine cross-court move - all three via actual `DragEvent`/`DataTransfer` dispatch, not just direct function calls, with every test's edits discarded (`cancelEditCourt`/`clearCourt`) so the real staged games for that round were never touched | ✅ |

| — | **Follow-on: check-in popup layout cleanup** — the player name was sharing a row with the Grade dropdown, wrapped to two lines, and squeezed the layout; Edit/checkboxes were oddly positioned. Reworked to: full-width name at the top, then Payment/Amount/Note, then Grade, then Edit on its own line, then First time visitor + New member together in one row - the modal is a fixed 380px wide, too narrow to fit Edit alongside two checkbox labels on one line without an awkward wrap, so they're split into their own rows instead of forced together. All IDs unchanged, so no JS logic needed touching; verified live that Edit still toggles the profile-edit panel open/closed correctly after the reshuffle | ✅ |

| — | **Follow-on: rounds played, visible directly on the Rounds page** — the round builder previously had no way to review earlier rounds without a trip to History; confirmed the underlying data/endpoint (`GET /api/history/sessions/:id`) already worked correctly for an *open* session, this was purely a discoverability gap. Added two ways to see it in place: (1) a "View rounds played" button opens a popup showing every round of the current session at once (`renderHistoryGameRow()` in `manage.js`, styling reused from the existing History page's `.round-block`/`.history-game` classes); (2) the "Currently on court" panel gained `‹`/`›` browse arrows next to the round number - stepping back shows that round's completed lineup (`GET /api/sessions/:id/games?round_number=X&status=completed`), stepping forward returns toward the live round (`status=active`), with `›` disabled once back at live. Verified live against the real open session: back-arrow correctly showed round 4's actual completed lineup, forward-arrow returned to round 5's live games and re-disabled correctly, and the popup listed all rounds 1-5 with correct players | ✅ |

| — | **Follow-on: "Finish session" button** — closing a session previously required a raw `PUT /api/sessions/:id {status:"closed"}` call with no UI anywhere to trigger it (a real gap - a club would have no way to end their night and start fresh next time without curl/devtools). Added a red "Finish session" button to the header on Check-in and Rounds (visible whenever a session is open), which confirms then flips `status` to `closed` - no data is touched or lost, and the session can be reopened the same way (same `PUT`, no dedicated UI for that side since finishing is meant to be the normal end-of-night action). Note: this is the simple status-flip only, not the fuller close-out spec described below (auto-move stragglers, stop the scheduler, show a summary screen) - that remains deferred. Verified live: clicked the real button, confirmed the app correctly dropped to "No session open" on both Check-in and Rounds, then reopened via the API and confirmed every round/attendance/payment record from the session was still intact and the UI picked back up exactly where it left off | ✅ |

Every feature above was verified end-to-end (curl for API correctness, then
live in a browser via the preview tools) before being marked done. Two real
bugs were caught and fixed during that verification (see "Bugs found and
fixed" below) — this is a good pattern to keep using for any future changes.

launcher.py             - source for GameScheduler.exe. Installs Node.js via winget if
                           missing, applies DB schema, starts server.js hidden, opens a
                           real native app window via pywebview (WebView2), stops the
                           server when that window closes; any startup failure shows a
                           real message box (no console to print to) instead of silently
                           doing nothing
GameScheduler.exe       - THE only file end users need, first run or the hundredth. A
                           real compiled exe (PyInstaller, --onefile --noconsole) - not a
                           batch file. Python/pywebview/pythonnet are bundled inside it;
                           the only thing it needs from the host machine is Node.js,
                           which it installs itself via winget on first run if missing.
                           Committed to git (~18MB) like node_modules is - nothing to
                           build at install time
build_exe.bat           - dev-only: rebuilds GameScheduler.exe from launcher.py via
                           PyInstaller. End users never run this
app_icon.ico             - GameScheduler.exe's icon (generated from public/icons/icon-512.png)
Stop.bat                - double-click: force-stops the server (manual fallback; normally
                           just close the app window instead)
node_modules/           - committed on purpose, not gitignored (see decisions below)
```

## Key design decisions already made (don't re-litigate these)

- **Skill compatibility matrix is symmetric**, not directional (spec flagged
  this as an open question; symmetric was the stated default and nobody's
  asked to change it).
- **No separate gender-compatibility toggle** — folded into general
  skill/gender balancing in the auto-generate algorithm, not a distinct grid.
- **`pairing_rules` has no `session_id` column** — `session_only` scope rules
  can't actually be tied to one specific session with the current schema, so
  `autoGenerate.js` treats every pairing rule as always-active regardless of
  scope. Flagged in a code comment. Would need a schema addition if a club
  actually needs session-scoped rules.
- **Recent-pairing lookback window is fixed at 4 rounds**, not yet
  club-editable (spec listed this as an open decision; punted).
- **Payment categories are club-wide and editable** from the Club page
  (add/rename/reorder/deactivate/delete-if-unused) but **prices are set per
  session template**, not club-wide — Friday social is deliberately cheaper
  than Monday evening in the seed data to prove this works.
- **"First time" is a simple boolean flag** on attendance (`first_time`),
  not a priced category and not a discount modifier on other categories —
  user was explicit: "just a flag to show that we have new people."
- **Social mode sessions never enter round/game logic at all** — no
  `current_phase` transitions ever happen (`phase_ends_at` stays null so the
  scheduler naturally skips them), the Rounds page shows an explanatory
  message instead of controls, and the API rejects round-start attempts with
  a clear 400 error as a defense-in-depth backstop.
- **Payment tracking is fully optional**, gated by the pre-existing
  `club_settings.square_enabled` checkbox (relabeled "Track payments..." on
  the Club page). When off: no Payment column on check-in, no rates fetched,
  everything behaves exactly like before the payment feature existed. When
  on: full category+amount+note+first-time recording via a modal, opened by
  clicking a player's payment cell in the "Here today" table.
- **The old simple `attendance.payment_method` enum (cash/card/voucher/
  other) was removed entirely**, replaced by the richer
  `payment_category_id` + `payment_amount_cents` + `payment_note` +
  `first_time` columns. This app only *records* what was charged for the
  club's own tracking — it does not process real payments; Square (or cash,
  physically) handles the actual transaction.
- **Removing a player mid-session** (double-click on "Here today" →
  confirm) sets `state='left'`, `left_reason='removed'`, and cleanly detaches
  them from any *staged* (not yet played) future-round games — active/
  completed games are never touched, preserving the audit trail. This cascade
  lives in `routes/attendance.js`'s PUT handler.
- **`node_modules` is committed to git, not gitignored**, and `package.json`
  uses exact pinned versions (no `^` ranges). The user explicitly required
  zero cloud dependency at *any* point, including install — caret ranges
  meant a fresh `npm install` could silently pull a different (and
  potentially breaking) version than what was actually tested, and a
  gitignored `node_modules` meant a fresh clone/copy needed internet access
  just to become runnable. Verified by copying the whole project to a
  location that never had `npm install` run against it and confirming it
  ran correctly from there alone.
- **Superseded: the original Edge `--app=` launcher couldn't tie the
  server's lifetime to the app window closing.** First attempt tried
  tracking the launched Edge process's PID and killing the server when it
  disappeared — broke immediately: Edge is a multi-process, single-instance
  browser, so a fresh `--app=` launch commonly hands off to an already-
  running Edge instance with no reliable process to track, killing the
  server within ~2 seconds of starting. Worked around at the time by giving
  the server its own console window as the one unambiguous stop control.
  **This whole problem is gone now** - `launcher.py`/`GameScheduler.exe`
  uses `pywebview` (an in-process, embedded WebView2 control, not a real
  Edge browser process) specifically so closing the window IS a reliable,
  native event (`window.events.closed`) with nothing to hand off to.
  Electron would also have solved this but was deliberately avoided (a
  bundled Chromium runtime is 150-200MB+ and doesn't fit the "vendor
  everything into git" approach at reasonable size) - pywebview gets the
  same reliability using WebView2, which Windows already ships.

## Bugs found and fixed during verification (context for future debugging)

1. **Seed script court-ID bug**: assumed court row IDs equal `court_number`
   (only true on a totally empty DB); broke on reseed because courts use
   `AUTOINCREMENT`. Fixed by capturing real inserted IDs and resetting
   `sqlite_sequence` at the top of `seed.js` for deterministic reseeds.
2. **Auto-generate double-booking bug**: `generateRound()`'s player pool
   only checked `attendance.state = 'here_today'`, not whether a player was
   already claimed by another *staged* game in the same round (staging
   deliberately doesn't change attendance state). Surfaced by the "Auto-
   generate round" button in the Rounds builder when filling remaining empty
   courts after a partial manual build. Fixed with a `NOT IN (...)`
   exclusion subquery; regression test added in `autoGenerate.test.js`.

## Explicitly NOT built yet / deferred

- **"Finish session" close-out summary screen** — a basic "Finish session"
  button now exists (see Follow-on above): it flips `status='closed'` with
  a confirm prompt, nothing more. The fuller spec (auto-move stragglers to
  `left`, stop the scheduler, and show a summary screen with peak headcount
  / rounds played / payment breakdown by category before/after closing) is
  still not built. Since all of that data already lives in the DB and the
  session report code (`lib/sessionReport.js`) already computes most of it
  for History/exports, the summary screen would mostly be wiring, not new
  logic — a reasonable next step if a club wants an end-of-night recap.
- **No formal README.md** — this file (`PROGRESS.md`) and `GameScheduler.exe`'s
  own on-screen messages cover most of what a README would, but the spec's
  original ask (Windows firewall prompt on first LAN bind, the
  QR-code-for-TV workflow specifically, and the OneDrive cross-machine sync
  gotchas) was never written up as a standalone polished doc.
- **Directional skill compatibility** — not built, symmetric only (see above).
- **Club-editable recent-pairing lookback window** — not built, fixed at 4.
- **`pairing_rules` session-scoping** — not built (see schema gap above).
- **Display screen has no special handling for social-mode sessions** — it
  falls back naturally (shows all courts as "free" forever, full waiting
  list) since no games are ever created, which is a reasonable default but
  wasn't purpose-built.

## Testing/verification pattern established this whole build

For any change: reseed (`node db/seed.js`) → restart server → test the raw
API via `curl` first (fast, precise) → then verify live in the browser via
the preview tools → check `read_console_messages` for JS errors → clean up
(stop test server, reseed fresh data) before ending the turn. Keep using
this — it caught both real bugs listed above.

## Environment quirks worth knowing

- **Browser pane screenshots often time out** on this project's pages (a
  recurring tooling quirk this whole session, not a bug in the app). When
  that happens, fall back to `read_page`/`get_page_text` and
  `javascript_tool` DOM inspection instead of `computer{action:"screenshot"}`
  — this has reliably worked as a substitute throughout the build.
- **`preview_start` with `{name: "game-scheduler"}`** uses
  `C:\Claude\.claude\launch.json` (already configured, port 4000). Using
  `{url: "http://localhost:4000/..."}` against a server already started via
  Bash also works and was more reliable in at least one session where the
  named-preview route seemed to serve stale state — if the browser pane ever
  shows data that doesn't match what you just seeded, suspect a stale/zombie
  server process and start fresh with `Get-Process node | Stop-Process
  -Force` before retrying.
- The Windows/git-bash path translation (`/c/Users/...` vs `C:\Users\...`)
  trips up Node scripts invoked from Bash with Unix-style paths — use
  relative paths or proper Windows paths when a Node one-liner needs to read
  a file written via a bash heredoc/redirect.
- If you're in a **remote/claude.ai session with no Bash/PowerShell/browser
  tools at all**, you obviously can't run the verification pattern above.
  Say so plainly rather than claiming something was tested - propose the
  change, and note it needs running locally to confirm.

## Suggested next steps (pick one, or something else)

1. Build the "Finish session" close-out summary screen (peak headcount /
   rounds played / payment breakdown) on top of the now-existing basic
   close button — biggest remaining spec gap.
2. Write the README / setup docs (firewall, QR code, OneDrive workflow).
3. Whatever new feature request comes up — this doc plus the code itself
   should be enough context to continue without re-deriving the whole
   history above.
